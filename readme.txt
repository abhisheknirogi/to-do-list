# To-Do List Web App

A simple and elegant **To-Do List** application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add, delete, filter, and mark tasks as completed**, while automatically saving tasks in **localStorage** so they persist even after page refresh.

- Delete individual tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed (click on task text)

- **All** — show every task  
- **Active** — show only incomplete tasks  
- **Completed** — show only finished tasks

Open the project folder.

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

 How It Works
When you add a task, it’s stored in the browser’s local Storage.
The timestamp is added using the system’s current time.
Clicking on a task toggles its completed status.
Tasks are re-rendered each time a change occurs, keeping the interface updated.
Filter buttons control which tasks are shown without deleting any data.
