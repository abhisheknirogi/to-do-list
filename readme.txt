# To-Do List Web App

A simple and elegant **To-Do List** application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add, delete, filter, and mark tasks as completed**, while automatically saving tasks in **localStorage** so they persist even after page refresh.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks with timestamps  
- Delete individual tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed (click on task text)  
- Filter tasks:
- **All** — show every task  
- **Active** — show only incomplete tasks  
- **Completed** — show only finished tasks  
-  Clear all completed tasks in one click  
-  Tasks are saved in browser local Storage

##  Project Structure

┣ style.css → Styling and layout

┗ README.md → Documentation


## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhisheknirogi/todo-list.git
Open the project folder.

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

 How It Works
When you add a task, it’s stored in the browser’s local Storage.
The timestamp is added using the system’s current time.
Clicking on a task toggles its completed status.
Tasks are re-rendered each time a change occurs, keeping the interface updated.
Filter buttons control which tasks are shown without deleting any data.

Text and cards: Clean, modern style
Buttons: Rounded with hover effects
Layout: Minimal and centered with subtle shadows
